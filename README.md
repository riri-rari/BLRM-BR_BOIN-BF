This repository contains the codes for the simulation of trials follwoing the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design and the Bayesian logistic regression (BLRM) design in the context of backfilling for the determination of the MTD in Phase I oncology trials.
The specific implementations are in the two folders along with all the explanations. 
If possible, enjoy :)
